# Plan: Fix TypeScript Build Errors in gemini-cli

## Notes
- TypeScript build fails due to improper error typing and missing/incorrect properties on context.services in chatCommand.ts.
- error objects should be type cast (e.g., (error as NodeJS.ErrnoException))
- context.services.config may not have a get method; context.services.chat may not exist on the type.
- Need to clarify the correct structure and usage of context.services and Config in the codebase.

## Task List
- [x] Fix error typing in ConversationLogger.ts (ENOENT error)
- [x] Fix error typing in chatCommand.ts (error as Error)
- [ ] Fix usage of context.services.config.get and context.services.chat in chatCommand.ts
- [ ] Clarify and update types/interfaces for context.services and Config as needed
- [ ] Ensure build passes without TypeScript errors

## Current Goal
Fix TypeScript build errors in chatCommand.ts
